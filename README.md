# Stake Lands

## Lands for Staking

Stake Lands is decentralized fantasy game in which anyone can stake on all sorts of real-life events and games where there is **competition**. Whether it's soccer, basketball, eSports or a TV Show in which you have people competing against one another, **stakers** can guess the results.

For every type of competition there is a LAND. As an example, there could be a LAND for soccer, and in the Soccer Land there could be multiple leagues (competitions) happening all around the world. Within leagues, there are teams playing against each other in matches (events). Stakers can engage in two ways: at the event level (the entire competition) or at a specific match level.

There is always a public lobby for every match and every competition, in which stakers can join and **optionally** put their tokens at stake. When the match or competition ends, all the lobby accumulated tokens are rewarded back to the winners, proportionally to the amount of tokens they staked in - meaning if they decided not to stake on anything, they also don't get rewards.

### Economy

Stake Lands has a community-driven economy. It's native virtual money is called "Stake Chip" (SCHIP - _to be confirmed_), a cryptocurrency used to:

* Stake on the lobbies
* Create new competitions under a LAND
* Vote on changes to the game
* Buy items in the marketplace, such as avatars

Anyone can propose new LANDs to be created, but they must be approved through a voting mechanism. Anyone can create new competitions under existing LANDs. A competition have lobbies where people can stack their SCHIPs to earn rewards if they win. A small portion of these rewards are given to the competition's creator, and another portion to the game's Treasury (we'll explain later what the Treasury is used for).

Creating a competition requires the owner to lock some of their SCHIP upfront, their SCHIPs are unlocked back after 6 months OR if the game's Treasury earns the same amount in fees as they locked (whatever happens first), this is a commitment required to avoid spam. This is an interesting approach as it provides a way for users to earn SCHIPs by creating new competitions in exchange for making a time and SCHIP commitment upfront, it also encourage's the owner to spread about their competition to bring people to lobbies.

Under a competition, there are players and matches. Players are managed by competition owners, and they are shared between all competitions under the same LAND. Anyone can contribute by creating/updating/deleting matches. These changes must be reviewed, and once approved they get released to all lobbies, and the contributor earns reputation (_under the LAND or across all LANDs to be defined_).
